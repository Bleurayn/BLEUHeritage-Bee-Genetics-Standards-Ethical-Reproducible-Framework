# Ethical Guidelines for Bee Genetics Research
## BLEUHeritage Framework
## Version 1.0.0

## Preamble
These guidelines establish ethical principles for bee genetics research, balancing scientific inquiry with respect for living organisms, ecosystems, and human communities. They implement the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance and align with international conservation ethics.

## 1. Core Ethical Principles

### 1.1 Respect for Life
**Principle**: Minimize harm to individual bees and colonies.
**Implementation**:
- Prefer non-lethal sampling methods when scientifically valid
- Limit sample size to statistical minimum
- Avoid collection during critical life stages (swarming, overwintering)
- Use humane methods when lethal sampling is necessary

### 1.2 Ecosystem Stewardship
**Principle**: Research should benefit or at minimum not harm ecosystems.
**Implementation**:
- Assess potential impacts on pollinator networks
- Avoid collection from threatened or endangered populations
- Support habitat conservation through research
- Share findings to inform conservation actions

### 1.3 Community Partnership
**Principle**: Engage with affected communities as partners.
**Implementation**:
- Obtain free, prior, and informed consent
- Include community representatives in study design
- Respect traditional knowledge and practices
- Ensure benefit-sharing arrangements

### 1.4 Data Sovereignty
**Principle**: Communities retain rights over their data.
**Implementation**:
- Implement CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority, Responsibility, Ethics)
- Establish data governance agreements
- Provide opt-out mechanisms
- Respect Indigenous knowledge protection

## 2. Implementation Framework

### 2.1 Tiered Ethical Review

#### Level 1: Standard Research
- Non-lethal methods only
- Common species
- Minimal ecosystem impact
- Rapid review (7 days)

#### Level 2: Moderate Impact
- Some lethal sampling
- Sensitive habitats
- Community engagement required
- Full review (30 days)

#### Level 3: High Impact
- Significant lethal sampling
- Endangered species
- Indigenous lands/knowledge
- Extended review (60+ days) with community consultation

### 2.2 Consent Procedures

#### Types of Consent Required:
1. **Land Access Consent**: From landowners/stewards
2. **Community Consent**: From affected communities
3. **Traditional Knowledge Consent**: For Indigenous knowledge
4. **Data Use Consent**: For specific research purposes
5. **Future Use Consent**: For unspecified future research

#### Consent Documentation:
- Written or recorded verbal consent
- Translated into local languages
- Explained in accessible terms
- Stored separately from research data
- Renewed annually or as circumstances change

### 2.3 Benefit-Sharing Framework

#### Monetary Benefits:
- Royalties from commercial applications
- Research funding to community projects
- Capacity building investments
- Equipment and infrastructure

#### Non-Monetary Benefits:
- Training and skill development
- Employment opportunities
- Co-authorship on publications
- Data access and interpretation support
- Educational materials development

### 2.4 Data Governance

#### Data Classification:
- **Public**: Aggregate statistics, generalized findings
- **Community**: Specific local results, with restrictions
- **Sensitive**: Location data, genetic sequences, traditional knowledge
- **Sacred**: Ritual knowledge, culturally sensitive information

#### Access Controls:
- Community approval for sensitive data access
- Purpose limitations in data use agreements
- Attribution requirements for all uses
- Regular access reviews and audits

## 3. Special Considerations

### 3.1 Indigenous Engagement

#### Key Principles:
- **Self-determination**: Indigenous control over research affecting them
- **Reciprocity**: Mutual benefit in research partnerships
- **Respect**: For cultural protocols and knowledge systems
- **Relationship**: Long-term, trust-based partnerships

#### Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Indigenous ethics review completed
- [ ] Cultural advisors engaged
- [ ] Traditional knowledge documented with proper attribution
- [ ] Benefits negotiated and agreed
- [ ] Data sovereignty plan established

### 3.2 Commercial Research

#### Additional Requirements:
- Clear separation of academic and commercial objectives
- Transparent funding sources
- Fair benefit-sharing agreements
- Independent ethical oversight
- Public reporting of findings

### 3.3 Citizen Science

#### Ethical Standards:
- Clear participant expectations
- Data quality assurance
- Privacy protection
- Appropriate recognition
- Access to results

## 4. Compliance and Monitoring

### 4.1 Documentation Requirements

#### Required Records:
- Ethical review approval documents
- Consent forms and records
- Benefit-sharing agreements
- Data governance plans
- Monitoring and audit reports

### 4.2 Monitoring Framework

#### Regular Assessments:
- Annual ethical compliance review
- Community satisfaction surveys
- Impact assessments
- Benefit-sharing implementation review

#### Audit Triggers:
- Complaint from community or participant
- Significant protocol deviation
- Commercialization of results
- Data breach or misuse

### 4.3 Non-Compliance Procedures

#### Steps for Violations:
1. Immediate suspension of affected activities
2. Investigation by independent committee
3. Corrective action plan
4. Transparent reporting
5. Restorative measures for harm caused
