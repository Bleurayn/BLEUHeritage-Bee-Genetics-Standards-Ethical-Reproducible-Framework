# BLEUHeritage Bee Sampling Protocol
## Version 1.0.0
## Effective Date: December 2025

## Overview
This protocol details standardized methods for collecting bee samples for genetic analysis while minimizing harm, ensuring sample integrity, and maintaining ethical standards.

## Quick Reference Table

| Step | Activity | Equipment Needed | Time Required |
|------|----------|------------------|---------------|
| 1 | Site Assessment | GPS, camera, field notebook | 15-30 min |
| 2 | Non-lethal Sampling | Forceps, collection tubes, ethanol | 5-10 min/bee |
| 3 | Preservation | 95-100% ethanol, cooler, labels | Immediate |
| 4 | Documentation | Chain of custody forms, camera | 5 min/sample |

## Detailed Procedures

### A. Pre-Sampling Preparation

#### 1. Equipment Checklist
- [ ] Collection tubes (2ml cryovials with O-rings)
- [ ] 95-100% ethanol (fresh, reagent grade)
- [ ] Fine forceps (entomology grade)
- [ ] Cooler with ice packs
- [ ] Pre-printed labels with QR/barcodes
- [ ] Chain of custody forms
- [ ] Digital camera
- [ ] GPS device (for internal records only)
- [ ] Personal protective equipment
- [ ] Field data sheets

#### 2. Site Preparation
1. **Consent Verification**: Confirm all required permissions
2. **Safety Assessment**: Identify hazards (terrain, weather, wildlife)
3. **Minimal Disturbance Plan**: Plan approach to minimize colony stress
4. **Contamination Prevention**: Sterilize equipment before use

### B. Non-Lethal Leg Clip Method (Preferred)

#### Procedure:
1. **Bee Capture**:
   - Approach colony calmly during peak foraging (10am-3pm)
   - Gently capture worker bee using soft forceps
   - Avoid grabbing thorax or abdomen
   - Target middle or hind legs

2. **Sample Collection**:
   - Hold bee by one leg
   - Clip single middle leg at tibia-femur joint using sterile scissors
   - Leg segment should be 1-2mm
   - Immediately place in 95% ethanol

3. **Bee Release**:
   - Release bee unharmed at collection site
   - Monitor briefly to ensure normal flight
   - Record any signs of distress

#### Success Indicators:
- Bee returns to normal activity within 60 seconds
- Sample contains full leg segment with tissues intact
- No visible damage to other body parts

### C. Whole Bee Collection (When Necessary)

#### When to Use:
- Pathogen screening requires whole body
- Multiple analyses needed (DNA, RNA, microbiome)
- Non-lethal method not feasible
- Regulatory requirements specify whole specimens

#### Procedure:
1. **Humane Collection**:
   - Capture bee as above
   - Place in sterile tube without ethanol
   - Chill at 4°C for 2-3 minutes to induce torpor
   - Immediately transfer to -20°C or liquid nitrogen

2. **Ethical Justification Required**:
   - Scientific necessity documented
   - Minimal number collected
   - No alternative method available
   - IACUC approval if required

### D. Sample Preservation

#### Ethanol Preservation (DNA):
1. Fill tubes 2/3 with 95-100% ethanol
2. Add sample immediately after collection
3. Ensure complete immersion
4. Store at 4°C in field
5. Replace ethanol after 24 hours if using whole specimens
6. Long-term storage at -80°C

#### RNAlater Preservation (RNA/DNA):
1. Use for transcriptomics studies
2. Submerge sample completely
3. Store at 4°C overnight
4. Transfer to -80°C within 48 hours

#### Dry Ice/Liquid Nitrogen (Multi-omics):
1. Flash freeze immediately
2. Store in vapor-phase liquid nitrogen
3. Maintain chain of custody for temperature monitoring

### E. Quality Control

#### Field QC Checklist:
- [ ] Sample ID matches label and form
- [ ] Preservation method correctly applied
- [ ] Ethanol clear (not cloudy)
- [ ] Tube properly sealed
- [ ] Temperature maintained (2-8°C)
- [ ] Documentation complete

#### Sample Rejection Criteria:
- Incorrect preservation method
- Insufficient tissue quantity
- Contamination visible
- Broken chain of custody
- Missing documentation

### F. Safety Procedures

#### Personal Safety:
1. **PPE Requirements**:
   - Bee veil or full suit if allergic
   - Nitrile gloves
   - Closed-toe shoes
   - Safety glasses (optional)

2. **Emergency Preparedness**:
   - Epinephrine auto-injector if team has allergies
   - First aid kit
   - Emergency contact information
   - Communication device

#### Environmental Protection:
1. Minimize disturbance to colonies
2. Avoid pesticide-treated areas
3. Follow local environmental regulations
4. Leave site as found

### G. Sample Documentation

#### Required Information:
1. **Sample ID**: Pre-assigned barcode/QR code
2. **Collection Details**: Date, time, collector name
3. **Site Information**: Generalized location, habitat type
4. **Collection Method**: Specific technique used
5. **Preservation Details**: Method, temperature, time
6. **Chain of Custody**: Initiator signature

#### Photographic Documentation:
- Site overview (avoiding sensitive details)
- Sample in situ (if possible)
- Collection equipment setup
- Label and tube before sealing

### H. Post-Collection Procedures

#### Immediate Actions (0-24 hours):
1. Transfer samples to proper storage temperature
2. Complete all documentation
3. Initiate chain of custody if transferring
4. Backup digital records

#### Within 48 Hours:
1. Review field notes for completeness
2. Verify sample IDs against documentation
3. Prepare samples for shipping if needed
4. Update sample tracking system

### I. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues and Solutions:

| Problem | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Cloudy ethanol | Tissue degradation | Replace ethanol, check temperature |
| Leg segment too small | Improper clipping | Practice technique, use magnification |
| Bee distress | Rough handling | Use softer forceps, minimize handling time |
| Label fading | Ethanol exposure | Use ethanol-resistant labels, seal properly |
| Temperature excursion | Cooler failure | Use temperature loggers, pack more ice |

### J. References and Standards

#### Regulatory Compliance:
- USDA APHIS guidelines for bee transport
- CITES regulations (if applicable)
- Local collection permit requirements
- IACUC protocols (if whole specimens)

#### Scientific Standards:
- MIxS standards for metadata
