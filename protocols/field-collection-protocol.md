# BLEUHeritage Bee Genetics Field Collection Protocol
## Version 1.0.0

## Purpose
Standardized protocol for ethical, reproducible collection of bee samples for genetic analysis.

## Pre-Collection Requirements

### 1. Permissions and Consents
- [ ] Landowner/steward consent obtained
- [ ] Collection permits secured (if required)
- [ ] Indigenous/traditional knowledge consent (if applicable)
- [ ] Institutional approvals (IACUC/IRB if needed)

### 2. Materials Preparation
- [ ] Labeled collection tubes with unique IDs
- [ ] 95-100% ethanol (for DNA preservation)
- [ ] Cooler with ice packs
- [ ] Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- [ ] Chain of custody forms
- [ ] GPS device (for internal records only)
- [ ] Camera for documentation

## Collection Procedure

### Step 1: Site Assessment
1. Record general location (region level for public data)
2. Note habitat type and dominant flora
3. Assess colony health indicators (optional)
4. Document management practices (if apiary)

### Step 2: Sample Collection
**Preferred method (non-lethal):**
1. Gently capture worker bee using soft forceps
2. Clip one middle leg at the tibia-femur joint
3. Immediately place in ethanol-filled tube
4. Release bee unharmed

**Alternative method (when necessary):**
1. Collect entire worker bee
2. Immediately euthanize humanely if required
3. Place whole bee in ethanol

### Step 3: Documentation
1. Complete chain of custody form
2. Take photos of collection site (avoiding sensitive details)
3. Record environmental conditions
4. Note any deviations from protocol

## Post-Collection

### Immediate Processing
1. Ensure tubes are properly sealed
2. Store in cooler at 2-8°C
3. Record storage temperature
4. Initiate chain of custody transfer if needed

### Sample Handling
1. Change ethanol after 24 hours if using whole specimens
2. Store at -20°C within 48 hours for long-term preservation
3. Document all storage location changes

## Ethical Considerations

### Minimizing Harm
- Prefer non-lethal methods when possible
- Minimize disturbance to colonies
- Collect minimum necessary sample size
- Consider seasonal timing to avoid stress

### Community Engagement
- Share benefits with local communities
- Respect traditional knowledge
- Provide results in accessible formats
- Acknowledge contributions appropriately

## Quality Control

### Field QC Checklist
- [ ] Sample IDs match chain of custody
- [ ] Preservation method properly applied
- [ ] Temperature control maintained
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Photos stored with correct IDs

## Safety
- Use appropriate PPE (veil, gloves)
- Have epinephrine available if allergic
- Work in pairs when possible
- Follow local safety regulations
